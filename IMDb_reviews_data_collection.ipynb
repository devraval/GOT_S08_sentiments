              "18121  1.0      Destroyed Entire Series.. I really love this series, this is why I'm giving 1 star for destroyed whole series with one episode. So many peoples would loved to see Snow & Dany rules together. Writers & Creators admit that you all failed this Series & broke hearts of GOT fans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
