This episode was was full of shock, excitement, humor, tension between a few characters, some nudity to spice things upðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚and many much awaited character reunions. Followed by the new amazing score by Ramin Djawadi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

              "18118  1.0      Explained to skeptical and haters I honestly don't know what they expected from the game of thrones, we were surprised as it always did. Spoiler: Many people got angry because Bran stayed with everything, but they just gave it to the throne for being the 3-eyed crow. Jon Snow went to the place where always felt full. We have had a worthy end. the construction of the characters was respected                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
